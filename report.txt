1. I finished everything
2. Didn't use banned STL components
3. No known bugs
4. This is how I tested RadixTree:

    s.insert("dog", "dummy");
    s.insert("dogskin", "dummy");
    s.insert("dogsk", "dummy");
    s.insert("dogskid", "dummy");
    s.insert("cat", "dummy");
    s.insert("cat", "dummyy");
    s.insert("Claw", "dummy");

    s.insert("Lima@icloud.com", "dummy"); // these were causing problems in my actual project
    s.insert("LogChristia9@icloud.com", "dummy");
    s.insert("LogCo0@comcast.net", "dummy");

And then I searched to make sure I can find all of them.

I also tested my other classes by duplicating members' attribute values (in members.txt) to make sure the duplicates aren't counted as another match ect.

I looked up a bunch of emails using my script as well as the provided executable and copy pasted the results into a text comparison website to make sure it was identical. If there was a discrepancy, I would use breakpoints to step through the code to see where	 it went wrong.
